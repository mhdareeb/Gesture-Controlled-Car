# Gesture-Controlled-Car
The problem is to design a car that can be controlled by simple hand gestures.
The user just needs to wear a gesture device in which a sensor is included. The sensor will record the movement of hand in a specific direction which will result in the motion of the car in the respective direction.
The car and the gesture instrument are connected wirelessly through radio waves.
